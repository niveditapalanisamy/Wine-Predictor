# Wine-Quality-Predictor
This project is based on predicting the quality of wine based on the parameters
  * fixed acidity 
  * volatile acidity
  * citric acid
  * residual sugar
  * chloride
  * free sulphur oxide
  * total suphur di oxide
  * density
  * pH
  * sulphates
  * alcohol
By taking these paremeters as input the quality of th wine is predicted as 0 or 1 If its 1 when quality score  is higher than 7 else 0 when the quality score is lesser than 7

## Libraries used
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib
  * StandardScaler
  * Decision Tree Classifier
  * Ada Boost Classifier
